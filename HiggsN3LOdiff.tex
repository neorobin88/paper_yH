We consider higher-order QCD corrections to Higgs boson production through gluon--gluon fusion in the large top quark mass limit in hadron collisions. We extend the transverse-momentum ($q_T$) subtraction method to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^{3}$LO) and combine it with the NNLO Higgs-plus-jet calculation to numerically compute differential infrared-safe observables at N$^{3}$LO for Higgs boson production in gluon fusion. To cancel the infrared divergences, we exploit the universal behaviour of the associated $\qt$ distributions in the small-$\qt$ region. We document all the necessary ingredients of the transverse-momentum subtraction method up to N$^{3}$LO. The missing third-order collinear functions, which contribute only at $\qt=0$, are approximated using a prescription which uses the known result for the total Higgs boson cross section at this order. As a first application of the third-order $\qt$ subtraction method, we present the  N$^{3}$LO rapidity distribution of the Higgs boson at the LHC.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
The most straightforward and successful (as well as systematically improvable) approach to calculations for processes at high-momentum scales $M$ in QCD is a perturbative expansion in the strong coupling $\as(M^{2})$. Cross sections are written as a series expansion in the parameter $\as$ and an improvement in accuracy is obtained by calculating an increasing number of coefficients in the series. Until a few years ago, the standard for such calculations was next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy. Recent years have seen a number of next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) results for many important processes of interest, such that the emerging standard for precision calculations relevant for LHC phenomenology is the second non-trivial order in the strong coupling $\as$.

Reducing the theoretical uncertainties remains one of the main motivations for the extension from NLO to NNLO accuracy. This is particularly relevant in two distinct situations. Firstly, NNLO corrections are mandatory for those processes where NLO corrections are comparable in size to the leading order (LO) contribution, both to establish the convergence of the perturbative expansion and to obtain reliable predictions. Secondly, many benchmark processes demand theoretical predictions with the highest possible precision to be able to fully exploit the extraordinary experimental precision that is achievable for this class of processes. Such ``standard candles'' are not only indispensable tools in detector calibration but also allow for a precise extraction of Standard Model (SM) parameters and parton distribution functions (PDFs).

Extending the perturbative accuracy of QCD calculations to one order higher implies developing new methods and techniques to achieve the cancellation of infrared (IR) divergences that appear at intermediate steps of the calculations. The past few years have witnessed a great development in NNLO subtraction prescriptions. The transverse momentum ($\qt$) subtraction method~\cite{Catani:2007vq,Bozzi:2005wk,Bonciani:2015sha}, the $N$-jettiness subtraction~\cite{Boughezal:2015eha, Gaunt:2015pea}, projection-to-Born~\cite{Cacciari:2015jma}, residue subtraction~\cite{Czakon:2011ve,Boughezal:2011jf}, and the antenna subtraction method~\cite{Antenna:method} have all been successfully applied for LHC phenomenology. 

However, in view of the impressive and continuously improving quality of the measurements performed at the LHC, even NNLO accuracy is in some cases not sufficient to match the demands of the LHC data. Typically, these are processes in which the size of the NLO corrections are comparable with the LO, and where the NNLO corrections still exhibit large effects such that the size of the theoretical uncertainties remains larger than the experimental uncertainties. 

This motivated a new theoretical effort to go beyond NNLO to include the next perturbative order: the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^{3}$LO). Sum rules, branching fractions~\cite{Chetyrkin:1994js} and deep inelastic structure functions~\cite{Vermaseren:2005qc} have been known to this order for quite some time. At present, the only hadron collider observables for which N$^{3}$LO QCD corrections have been calculated are the total cross section for Higgs boson  production in gluon fusion~\cite{Anastasiou:2015ema,Mistlberger:2018etf} and in vector boson 
fusion~\cite{Dreyer:2016oyx}. First steps have been taken towards more differential observables by computing the first N$^{3}$LO threshold expansion terms to the Higgs boson rapidity distribution in gluon fusion~\cite{Dulat:2017prg}. Moreover, the projection-to-Born method has been most recently extended to compute fully differential distributions to N$^{3}$LO, with a proof-of-principle calculation~\cite{Currie:2018fgr} of jet production in deep inelastic scattering. 

In this paper, we present the generalisation of the $\qt$ subtraction method to N$^{3}$LO and use it to compute Higgs boson production differentially in the Higgs boson rapidity at N$^{3}$LO accuracy. The paper is organized as follows: in Sec.~\ref{sec:forma} we recall briefly the main ideas of the $\qt$ subtraction formalism and we present the necessary ingredients up to  N$^{3}$LO, specifying which elements are known analytically and identifying the missing coefficients at N$^{3}$LO. In Sec.~\ref{sec:numforCN3} we present a prescription for approximating the missing collinear functions at N$^{3}$LO based on the unitarity property of the integral of the transverse momentum distribution. In Sec.~\ref{sec:rapgen}, we apply the $\qt$ subtraction formalism at N$^{3}$LO to produce differential distributions in the rapidity of the Higgs boson. To validate our approach, Sec.~\ref{sec:NNLOrap} quantifies the quality of the approximations by repeating them at NNLO, where all of the ingredients to $\qt$ subtraction are known. We assess the magnitude of different sources of systematic uncertainties at  N$^{3}$LO in Sec.~\ref{sec:N3LOrap}, yielding final results for the N$^{3}$LO Higgs boson rapidity distribution and the associated theoretical uncertainty in Sec.~\ref{sec:results}. Finally, in Sec.~\ref{Sec:conclu} we summarize our results.

\section{The \texorpdfstring{$\qt$}{qT} subtraction formalism at \texorpdfstring{N${}^\text{3}$LO}{N3LO}}
\label{sec:forma}
This section is devoted to the generalization of the transverse-momentum subtraction formalism to N$^{3}$LO in perturbative QCD. The method is illustrated in its general form and special attention is paid to the case of Higgs boson production through gluon--gluon fusion. The $\qt$ subtraction formalism presented in this section is the third order extension of the subtraction method originally proposed in Refs.~\cite{Catani:2007vq,Bozzi:2005wk,Bonciani:2015sha}.

We consider the inclusive hard scattering reaction 
\begin{equation}
h_1(p_1)+h_2(p_2)\to F(\{q_i\})+X\, ,
\label{class}
\end{equation}
where $h_1$ and $h_2$ are the two hadrons which collide with momenta $p_1$ and $p_2$ producing the identified colourless final-state system $F$, accompanied by an arbitrary and undetected final state $X$. The colliding hadrons have centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt s$, and are treated as massless particles $(s= (p_1+p_2)^2 = 2p_1\cdot p_2)$. The observed final state $F$ consists of a generic system of non-QCD partons composed of {\em one} or {\em more} colour singlet particles (such as vector bosons, photons, Higgs bosons, Drell--Yan (DY) lepton pairs and so forth) with momenta $q_i^{\mu}$ $(i=3,4,5,\dots)$. The total momentum of the system $F$ is denoted by $q^{\mu}$ ($q=\sum_i q_i$) and it can be expressed in terms of the total invariant mass $M$ $(q^2=M^2)$, the transverse momentum $\bqt$ with respect to the direction of the colliding hadrons, and the rapidity $y$ $(2y = \ln (p_2\cdot q/p_1\cdot q))$ in the centre-of-mass system of the collision. 
Since $F$ is colourless, the LO partonic Born cross section can be either initiated by $q\bar{q}^{\prime}$ annihilation, as in the case of the Drell--Yan process, or by gluon--gluon fusion, as in the case of Higgs boson production.

In order to explain the basic idea  of the subtraction formalism, we first notice that at LO, the transverse momentum $\mathbf{q}_{T}=\sum_i \mathbf{q}_{T\;i}$ of the final state system $F$ is identically zero. Therefore, as long as $\qt \neq 0$, the N$^{n}$LO QCD contributions (with $n=1,2,3$) are given by the N$^{n-1}$LO QCD contributions to the $F$+jet(s) final state. Consequently, if $\qt \neq 0$ we have:
\begin{equation}
\label{Eq:first}
\rd\sigma^{F}_{\rm N^{n}LO}(\qt \neq0) \equiv \rd\sigma^{F+{\rm jets}}_{\rm N^{n-1}LO}\;\;\;\;{\rm with}\;\;\; n=1,2,3\;.
\end{equation}
The notation N$^{n}$LO stands for: N$^{0}$LO=LO, N$^{1}$LO=NLO, N$^{2}$LO=NNLO and so forth. Equation~\eqref{Eq:first} implies that if $\qt \neq 0$ the infrared (IR) divergences that appear in the computation of $\rd\sigma^{F}_{\rm N^{n}LO}(\qt \neq0)$ are those already present in $\rd\sigma^{F+{\rm jets}}_{\rm N^{n-1}LO}$.
Therefore, provided that the IR singularities involved in $\rd\sigma^{F}_{\rm N^{n}LO}(\qt \neq0)$ can be handled and cancelled with the available subtraction methods at N$^{n-1}$LO, the only remaining singularities at  N$^{n}$LO are associated with the limit $\qt \rightarrow 0$ and we treat them with the transverse momentum subtraction method. Since the small-$\qt$ behaviour of the transverse momentum distribution is well known through the resummation program~\cite{qTRes:program} of logarithmically-enhanced contributions to transverse-momentum distributions, we exploit this knowledge to construct the necessary N$^{n}$LO counterterms (CT) to subtract the remaining singularity at $\qt=0$, thereby promoting the $\qt$ subtraction method proposed in Refs.~\cite{Catani:2007vq} to N$^{3}$LO. 

The generic form of the $\qt$ subtraction method~\cite{Catani:2007vq} for the N$^{n}$LO cross section is
 \begin{equation}
 \label{masterEqqT}
 \rd\sigma^{F}_{\rm N^{n}LO} = \mathcal{H}^{F}_{\rm N^{n}LO} \otimes \rd\sigma^{F}_{\rm LO} + \big[ \rd\sigma^{F+{\rm jets}}_{\rm N^{n-1}LO} -  \rd\sigma^{F\;{\rm CT}}_{\rm N^{n}LO} \big]\;\;\;\;{\rm with}\;\;\; n=1,2,3\;,
 \end{equation}
where $\rd\sigma^{F\;{\rm CT}}_{\rm N^{n}LO}$ is the contribution of the counterterm to the N$^{n}$LO cross section which cancels the divergences of $\rd\sigma^{F+{\rm jets}}_{\rm N^{n-1}LO}$ in the limit $\qt \rightarrow 0$ and renders the term in square brackets finite for all values of $\qt$. 
The $n$-th order counterterm can be written as
\begin{equation}
  \rd\sigma^{F\;{\rm CT}}_{\rm N^{n}LO} =   \Sigma^{F}_{\rm N^{n}LO}(\qt^{2}/M^{2})\;\rd^{2}\mathbf{q}_{T}   \otimes \rd\sigma^{F}_{\rm LO}\;,
\end{equation}
where the symbol $ \otimes$ denotes convolutions over momentum fractions and sums over flavour indices of the partons.
More precisely, the function $\Sigma^{F}_{\rm N^{n}LO}(\qt^{2}/M^{2})$ is the $n$-th order truncation of the perturbative series in $\as$
\beeq
\Sigma^{F}_{c\bar{c}\leftarrow ab}\left(\f{\qt^{2}}{M^{2}};\f{M^2}{\hat s};\as;
\f{M^2}{\mu_R^2},\f{M^2}{\mu_F^2}\right)=  \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{\as}{\pi} \right)^n \Sigma^{F;(n)}_{c\bar{c}\leftarrow ab}\left(\f{\qt^{2}}{M^{2}};\f{M^2}{\hat s};
\f{M^2}{\mu_R^2},\f{M^2}{\mu_F^2}\right)\;,
\label{eq:sigexpansion}
\eeeq
where the labels $a$ and $b$ stands for the partonic channels of the N$^{n}$LO correction to the Born cross section ($\rd\sigma^{F}_{\rm LO}\equiv \rd\big[\sigma^{F;(0)}_{c\bar{c}}\big]$). Notice that at LO, the only available configuration is $a=c$ and $b=\bar{c}$, where $c\bar{c}$ is (are) the partonic channel(s) through which the LO cross section is initiated.
The function $ \Sigma^{F}(\qt^{2}/M^{2})$ embodies all the logarithmic terms that are divergent in the limit $\qt \rightarrow 0$ reproducing the singular behaviour of  $\rd\sigma^{F+{\rm jets}}$ in the small-$\qt$ limit. The definition of the counterterm is free of terms proportional to $\delta(\qt^{2})$ which are all absorbed in the perturbative factor $\mathcal{H}^{F}$. The hard coefficient function $\mathcal{H}^{F}_{\rm N^{n}LO}$  that encodes all the IR finite terms of the $n$-loop contributions, is obtained by the N$^{n}$LO truncation of the perturbative function
\begin{equation}
\label{Hstexpand}
{\cal H}^F_{c\bar{c}\ito ab}\left(\f{M^2}{\hat s};\as;
\f{M^2}{\mu_R^2},\f{M^2}{\mu_F^2}\right)=\delta_{c\,a} \,\delta_{\bar{c}\,b}\;\delta(1-z)+
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(\frac{\as}{\pi}\right)^n 
{\cal H}^{F;(n)}_{c\bar{c}\ito ab}\left(z;
\f{M^2}{\mu_R^2},\f{M^2}{\mu_F^2}\right)\;\; ,
\end{equation}
where $z=M^{2}/\hat{s}$. According to the transverse momentum resummation formula (Eq.~(10) of Ref.~\cite{Bozzi:2005wk}) and using the Fourier--Bessel transformation between the conjugate variables $\qt$ and the impact parameter $b$, the perturbative hard function $\mathcal{H}^{F}$ and the corresponding counterterm are obtained by the fixed-order truncation of the identity
\beeq
\label{reslean}
&&\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\left( \Sigma^{F}_{c\bar{c}\leftarrow ab}\left(\f{\qt^{2}}{M^{2}};\f{M^2}{\hat s};\as\right) + \mathcal{H}^{F}_{c\bar{c}\leftarrow ab}\left(\f{M^2}{\hat s};\as\right) \right) \otimes \rd\big[\sigma^{F;(0)}_{c\bar{c}}\big]_{ab} =\f{M^{2}}{s}
\int_0^\infty \rd b \f{b}{2} J_0(b\qt)\\
&&\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\ \times  \;S_c(M,b) \int_{x_{1}}^1 \f{\rd z_1}{z_{1}} \int_{x_{2}}^1  \f{\rd z_2}{z_{2}} \rd\hat{\sigma}^{F;(0)}_{c\bar{c}} \,
 f_{a/h_1}\left(x_{1}/z_1,b_0^2/b^2\right)f_{b/h_2}\left(x_{2}/z_2,b_0^2/b^2\right)\;\left[ H^{F} C_1 C_2 \right]_{c\bar{c};ab}\,, \nn
\eeeq
where $J_0(b \qt)$ is the $0$-th order Bessel function, $f_{c/h}$ corresponds to the distribution of a parton $c$ in a hadron $h$ and $b_0=2 \mathrm{e}^{-\gamma_E}$ ($\gamma_E=0.5772...$  is the Euler--Mascheroni constant). In the left-hand side of Eq.~\eqref{reslean}, we omit the full scale dependence of these coefficients, which is however, fully specified in Eqs.~\eqref{eq:sigexpansion} and \eqref{Hstexpand}. The symbolic factor $\rd\hat{\sigma}^{F;(0)}_{c\bar{c}}$ for the partonic Born cross section $\hat{\sigma}^{F;(0)}_{c\bar{c}}$ denotes
\beeq
\rd\hat{\sigma}^{F;(0)}_{c\bar{c}}\equiv \f{\rd\hat{\sigma}^{F;(0)}_{c\bar{c}}}{\rd\phi}\;,
\eeeq 
where $\phi$ represents the phase space of the final state system $F$. In the left-hand side of Eq.~\eqref{reslean} the convolution (as well as sum over flavour indices of the partons) between the resummation functions $\Sigma^{F}_{c\bar{c}}$ and $\mathcal{H}^{F}_{c\bar{c}}$, the partonic Born cross section and the parton distributions is symbolically denoted by $\otimes \rd\big[\sigma^{F;(0)}_{c\bar{c}}\big]_{ab}$.

The large logarithmic corrections are exponentiated in the Sudakov form factor $S_c(M,b)$ of the quark  ($c=q, {\bar q}$) or of the gluon ($c=g$), which has the following  expression:
\begin{equation}
\label{formfact}
S_c(M,b) = \exp \left\{ - \int_{b_0^2/b^2}^{M^2} \frac{\rd q^2}{q^2} 
\left[ A_c(\as(q^2)) \;\ln \frac{M^2}{q^2} + B_c(\as(q^2)) \right] \right\} 
\;\;. 
\end{equation}
The functions $A$ and $B$  in Eq.~\eqref{formfact} permit a perturbative expansion in $\as$:
\beeq
\label{aexp}
A_c(\as) &=& \sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{\as}{\pi} \right)^n A_c^{(n)} 
\;\;, \\
\label{bexp}
B_c(\as) &= &\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{\as}{\pi} \right)^n B_c^{(n)}
\;\;.
\eeeq

The structure of the symbolic factor denoted by $\left[ H^{F} C_1 C_2 \right]_{c\bar{c};a b}$ in Eq.~\eqref{reslean}, depends on the initial-state channel of the Born subprocess and is explained in detail in Refs.~\cite{Catani:2010pd,Catani:2013tia}. Here we limit ourselves to the case in which the final state system $F$ is composed of a single Higgs boson
\beeq
\label{whathlean}
\left[ H^{F=H} C_1 C_2 \right]_{gg;ab}
&= H_{g}^{F=H}(\as(M^2)) &\;\left[ \; C_{g \,a}(z_1;\as(b_0^2/b^2)) 
\;\, C_{g \,b}(z_2;\as(b_0^2/b^2)) \right.
\nn \\
&&+ \left.  G_{g \,a}(z_1;\as(b_0^2/b^2)) 
\;\, G_{g \,b}(z_2;\as(b_0^2/b^2)) \;
\right]
\;\;,
\eeeq
where 
$H_{g}^{F=H}(\as)$ is the hard--virtual function, and $C_{g \,a}$ and $G_{g \,a}$ are 
gluonic helicity-preserving and helicity-flipping hard--collinear coefficient functions respectively.

Note that the right-hand side of Eq.~\eqref{whathlean} does not depend on the direction of $\bf b$ and this implies that the $\bqt$ distribution has no azimuthal correlations in the small-$\qt$ region for Higgs boson production~\cite{Catani:2010pd}. 
Note also that the term with two $G_{g \,a}(z;\as)$ functions in Eq.~\eqref{whathlean} is the double helicity-flip contribution: helicity conservation in the hard-process factor for Higgs boson production forbids contributions with a single helicity flip. 
The helicity-flip $G_{g \,a}(z;\as)$ functions are absent in processes initiated at the Born level by quark annihilation~\cite{Catani:2010pd}. 

The gluonic hard--collinear coefficient function $C_{g \,a}(z;\as)$ ($a=q,{\bar q},g$) has the following perturbative expansion
\begin{equation}
\label{cgexp} 
C_{g \,a}(z;\as) = \delta_{g \,a} \;\,\delta(1-z) + 
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{\as}{\pi} \right)^n C_{g\, a}^{(n)}(z) \;\;.
\end{equation}
In contrast, the perturbative expansion of the helicity flip hard--collinear coefficient function $G_{ga}$, which is specific to gluon-initiated processes, starts only at ${\cal O}(\as)$, and can be written as~\cite{Catani:2010pd,Catani:2013tia}
\begin{equation}
\label{gfexp}
G_{g \,a}(z;\as) =
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left( \frac{\as}{\pi} \right)^n G_{g \,a}^{(n)}(z) \;\;.
\end{equation}
The IR finite contribution of the $n$-loop correction terms to the Born subprocess are contained in the hard--virtual function
\begin{equation}
\label{hexp}
H_g^{F=H}(\as) = 1+ \sum_{n=1}^\infty 
\left( \frac{\as}{\pi} \right)^n 
H_g^{F=H \,;(n)}
\;\;.
\end{equation} 

The resummation formula in the right-hand side of Eq.~\eqref{reslean} is invariant under ``resummation scheme''  transformations~\cite{Catani:2000vq}, whereas the individual coefficients $H_g^{F=H}$, $B_{g}$, $C_{g\, a}$ and $G_{g\, a}$ are not separately resummation scheme independent. Throughout this paper we always use the \textit{hard scheme}~\cite{Catani:2013tia} to report explicit expressions for the perturbative expansion of these individual coefficients. The \textit{hard scheme} states that all the contributions proportional to $\delta(1-z)$ are associated with the hard--virtual functions $H_c^{F}$. This directly implies that $H_c^{F}$ is process dependent whereas the collinear $C_{ab}$ functions and the resummation coefficients $B_{c}$ are independent of the final state system $F$. In addition, the resummation coefficients $A_{c}$ and the helicity-flip functions $G_{ab}$ are also independent of the final state.
%The physical origin of the  resummation scheme invariance of Eq.~\eqref{reslean} is discussed in  Ref.~\cite{Catani:2000vq}. 

The truncation of Eq.~\eqref{reslean} at a given fixed order requires the explicit knowledge of resummation coefficients and hard collinear coefficient functions.
For $F=H$ at NLO, the knowledge of the coefficients $A^{(1)}_{g}$, $B^{(1)}_{g}$, $C^{(1)}_{ga}$ ($a=q,{\bar q},g$) and $H^{H;(1)}_{g}$ are sufficient to compute the inclusive total cross section and differential distributions. Assuming that the Higgs boson couples to a single heavy quark of mass $m_Q$, the first-order coefficient $H_g^{H;(1)}$ in the hard resummation scheme is~\cite{Catani:2013tia}
\begin{equation}
\label{H1g}
H_g^{H;(1)}=C_A\pi^2/2+c_H(m_Q)\, .
\end{equation}
The function $c_H(m_Q)$, which depends on the NLO virtual corrections of the Born subprocess, is given in Eq.~(B.2) of Ref.~\cite{Spira:1995rr}. In the limit $m_Q\to \infty$, the function $c_H$ becomes
%$\rd\sigma^{F}_{\rm LO}$
\begin{equation}
c_H(m_Q)\longrightarrow\f{5C_A-3C_F}{2}=\f{11}{2}\, .
\end{equation}
Therefore, the complete set of coefficients necessary to compute Higgs boson production (in the limit in which the mass of the top quark $Q=t$ is larger than any other scale involved in the process) at NLO is
\beeq
\label{eq:nloconstants}
A^{(1)}_{g}=C_{A}\;,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;&&B^{(1)}_{g}=- \f{1}{6} \left( 11 C_A - 2 N_f \right)\;,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;H^{H;(1)}_{g}=\f{1}{2}(11+C_{A}\pi^{2})\;,\nn\\
&&\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!C^{(1)}_{ga}(z)=\f{1}{2}C_F\, z\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\left[a=q,{\bar q}\right]\;,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;C^{(1)}_{gg}(z)=0\;.
\eeeq
The coefficients $A^{(1)}_{g}$ and $B^{(1)}_{g}$ are process {\em and} resummation scheme independent. The collinear functions $C^{(1)}_{ga}$ ($a=q,{\bar q},g$) are process independent, while $H^{H;(1)}_{g}$ depends on the final-state system $(F=H)$. Together,  they depend on the resummation scheme in such a way to ensure the resummation scheme independence of Eq.~\eqref{reslean} at NLO. In Ref.~\cite{deFlorian:2001zd} was shown that the NLO hard--virtual coefficient $H^{F;(1)}_{c}$ is explicitly related to $\rd{\hat \sigma}^{F}_{\rm LO}$ and to the IR finite part of the NLO virtual correction to the Born cross section. 

At NNLO, the coefficients $A^{(2)}_{g}$ and $B^{(2)}_{g}$ are needed~\cite{Bozzi:2005wk,Catani:2013tia,deFlorian:2001zd},
\beeq
\label{A2andB2}
A^{(2)}_{g}= \frac{1}{2}\; C_A \left[ \left( \f{67}{18} - \f{\pi^2}{6}
\right) C_A - \f{5}{9} N_f \right] \;\;,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;B^{(2)}_{g}=\f{\gamma_{g}^{(1)}}{16}+\beta_0\, C_A\,\zeta_2\;,
\eeeq
where $\gamma_{g}^{(1)}$ is the coefficient of the $\delta(1-z)$ term in the NLO gluon splitting function~\cite{Curci:1980uw,Furmanski:1980cm}, which reads
\begin{equation}
\gamma_{g}^{(1)}= \left(-\frac{64}3-24\zeta_3\right)\,C_A^2
+\frac{16}3\,C_A N_f
+4\,C_F N_f\;,
\label{ga1g}
\end{equation}
and $\zeta_n$ denotes the Riemann zeta-function for integer values $n$ ($\zeta_2=\pi^2/6$, $\zeta_3=1.202\dots$, $\zeta_4=\pi^4/90$). The coefficient $A^{(2)}_{g}$ does not depend on the resummation scheme whereas $B^{(2)}_{g}$  in Eq.~\eqref{A2andB2} is valid in the hard resummation scheme and both coefficients are process independent. The collinear functions $C^{(2)}_{ab}$ in the hard resummation scheme can be extracted from Refs.~\cite{Catani:2013tia,Catani:2011kr,Catani:2012qa} and are also not dependent on the final state system $F$. These collinear coefficients $C^{(2)}_{ab}$ have been independently computed in Refs.~\cite{Gehrmann:2012ze,Echevarria:2016scs}.

The general structure of the hard--virtual coefficients $H^{F}_{c}$ has been established in Ref.~\cite{Catani:2013tia}. Although $H^{F}_{c}$ is in principle process dependent, Ref.~\cite{Catani:2013tia} showed it can be directly related in a universal way to the IR finite part of the all-order virtual amplitude of the corresponding partonic subprocess $c{\bar c}\to F$. The relationship between $H^{F}_{c}$ and the all-order virtual correction to the  partonic subprocess $c{\bar c}\to F$ has been made explicit up to NNLO and is based on the definition of universal subtraction operators that cancel the IR divergences of the two-loop (NNLO) virtual corrections to the Born cross section~\cite{Catani:1998bh}. These universal second-order operators contain an IR finite term of soft origin ($\delta^{(1)}_{\qt}$) that only depends on the initial-state partons~\cite{Catani:2013tia}.

In the case of Higgs boson production, the hard--virtual factor $H^{F=H;(2)}_{g}$ in the large-$m_t$ limit (in the hard resummation scheme) is given by~\cite{Catani:2011kr}
\begin{align}
\label{H2g}
H_g^{H;(2)}&=C_A^2\left(
\f{3187}{288}+\f{7}{8}L_t+\f{157}{72}\pi^2+\f{13}{144}\pi^4-\f{55}{18}\zeta_3\right)+C_A\, C_F\left(-\f{145}{24}-\f{11}{8}L_t-\f{3}{4}\pi^2\right)\nn\\
&+\f{9}{4}C_F^2
-\f{5}{96}C_A-\f{1}{12}C_F-C_A\, N_f\left(\f{287}{144}+\f{5}{36}\pi^2+\f{4}{9}\zeta_3\right)
+C_F\, N_f\left(-\f{41}{24}+\f{1}{2}L_t+\zeta_3\right)\, ,
\end{align}
where $L_t=\ln (M_H^2/m_t^2)$. The two-loop scattering amplitude~\cite{Harlander:2009bw}  used in the computation of  $H^{F=H;(2)}_{g}$ includes corrections to the large-$m_t$ approximation.
At NNLO, in Eq.~\eqref{whathlean} (which is proportional to $\delta(\qt^{2})$) the first order $G_{ga}^{(1)}$ helicity-flip functions are required which read~\cite{Catani:2010pd}
\begin{equation}
G_{g \,a}^{(1)}(z) = C_a \;\f{1-z}{z}~~~~~~~~~~~a=q,\bar{q},g\, ,
\end{equation}
where $C_{q;\bar{q}}=C_{F}$ and $C_g=C_{A}$. The first-order functions $G_{ga}^{(1)}$ are resummation-scheme independent and do not depend on the final-state system $F$.

At N$^{3}$LO, the numerical implementation of Eq.~\eqref{reslean} requires the following ingredients: $A^{(3)}_{g}$, $B^{(3)}_{g}$, $C^{(3)}_{ga}$, $G^{(2)}_{ga}$ ($a=q,{\bar q},g$) and $H^{H;(3)}_{g}$. The coefficient $A_g^{(3)}$~\cite{Becher:2010tm} reads
\beeq
\label{acoeff}
A_g^{(3)}\!\!\!&&\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!  =  C_A^3 \left( \frac{245}{96} - \frac{67}{36}\zeta_2
 + \frac{11}{24}\zeta_3 + \frac{11}{20}\zeta_2^2\right) 
 + C_A C_F N_f \left(-\frac{55}{96} + \frac{1}{2}\zeta_3\right)
 - C_A N_f^2 \frac{1}{108} \nn\\
 &+& \!\!C_A^2 N_f \left(-\frac{209}{432} + \frac{5}{18}\zeta_2 - \frac{7}{12} \zeta_3\right)  
 + \beta_{0} C_A^2\left(\frac{101}{27}-\frac{7}{2}\zeta_{3}\right)- \beta_{0} C_A N_f \frac{14}{27}\,.
\eeeq
The explicit expression of the $B_c^{(3)}$ ($a=q,g$) coefficients in the hard scheme can be computed from Refs.~\cite{Li:2016ctv,Vladimirov:2016dll}. In the particular case of the gluon channel we have
\beeq
B_g^{(3)}&=& - \f{2133}{64} +  \f{3029}{576} N_{f} - \f{349}{1728} N_{f}^{2}  + \f{109}{6} \pi^{2} - \f{283}{144} \pi^{2}  N_{f} + \f{5}{108} \pi^{2}  N_{f}^{2}-\f{253}{160} \pi^{4}+\f{23}{240} \pi^{4} N_{f}\nn\\
&-& \f{843}{8} \zeta_{3} + 2 \zeta_{3} N_{f} + \f{1}{6} \zeta_{3} N_{f}^{2} + \f{9}{4} \pi^{2}  \zeta_{3} + \f{135}{2}  \zeta_{5}\;.
\eeeq

The analytical form of the function $\Sigma^{F;(3)}$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:sigexpansion} can be obtained by expanding Eq.~\eqref{reslean} to the corresponding matching order. The full analytical formula for $\Sigma^{F}$ is resummation scheme independent order by order in the strong coupling constant. Therefore, the logarithmic singular behaviour for $\Sigma^{F}$ at $\qt\rightarrow 0$ at 
each given order in $\as$ does not depend on the 
resummation scheme, and can be validated against the behaviour of the fixed-order results at small $\qt$. To fully 
account for the logarithmically enhanced terms at a given order requires a sufficient depth in the resummation accuracy prior to 
its fixed-order expansion in Eq.~\eqref{eq:sigexpansion}. Specifically, the LO Higgs boson $\qt$ distribution receives singular contributions from up to NLL (next-to-leading-logarithm) resummation~\cite{Catani:1988vd,Kauffman:1991cx}, the NLO Higgs boson $\qt$ distribution requires the expansion of NNLL resummation~\cite{deFlorian:2001zd,deFlorian:2000pr,Becher:2012yn,Neill:2015roa}, and the NNLO Higgs boson $\qt$ distribution has been recently validated against the singular contributions from N$^3$LL resummation~\cite{Chen:2018pzu,Bizon:2018foh}. 

The function $\mathcal{H}^{F=H;(3)}_{gg\leftarrow ab}$, which is proportional to $\delta(q^{2}_{T})$, contains $H^{H;(3)}_{c}$, $C^{(3)}_{ga}$ and $G^{(2)}_{ga}$,  that are only known in parts or not at all. Nevertheless, within the $\qt$ subtraction  formalism, ${\cal H}^{F \,;(3)}$ can be inferred for any hard scattering process whose corresponding total cross section is known at N$^{3}$LO. This point is discussed in detail in the next section.

\section{The Higgs boson total cross section at \texorpdfstring{N${}^\text{3}$LO}{N3LO}}
\label{sec:numforCN3}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We start this section with some observations related to the hard-scattering function ${\cal H}_{c{\bar c} \ito ab}^{F}$. This function is resummation-scheme independent, but it depends on the specific hard-scattering subprocess $c + {\bar c} \to F$. The coefficients ${\cal H}_{c{\bar c} \ito ab}^{F \,;(n)}$ of the perturbative expansion in Eq.~\eqref{Hstexpand} can be determined by performing a perturbative calculation of the $\qt$ distribution in the limit $\qt \to 0$. In the right-hand side of Eq.~\eqref{reslean},  the function ${\cal H}^{F}$ controls the strict perturbative normalization of the corresponding total cross section (i.e.\ the integral of the total $\qt$ distribution). This unitarity-related property can be exploited to determine the coefficients ${\cal H}_{c{\bar c} \ito ab}^{F \,;(n)}$ from the perturbative calculation of the total cross section.  At the partonic level, the integral of the total $\qt$ distribution in Eq.~\eqref{masterEqqT} must be equal to the total cross section ${\hat \sigma}_{F \,ab}^{{\rm {tot}}}$,
\begin{equation}
\label{restotp}
{\hat \sigma}_{F \,ab}^{{\rm {tot}}}(M,{\hat s};
\as(\mu_R^2),\mu_R^2,\mu_F^2)
 = \int_0^{\infty} \rd\qt^2 \;
\f{\rd{\hat \sigma}_{F \,ab}}{\rd \qt^2}(\qt,M,{\hat s};
\as(\mu_R^2),\mu_R^2,\mu_F^2) 
 \;.
\end{equation}
Since the the hard-scattering function ${\cal H}_{c{\bar c} \ito ab}^{F}$ is simply proportional to $\delta(\qt^{2})$, we evaluate the $\qt$ spectrum on right-hand side of Eq.~\eqref{masterEqqT} according to the following decomposition
\beeq
\label{sigtotrel} 
{\hat \sigma}_{F \,ab}^{{\rm {tot}}}
 = \f{M^2}{\hat s} \;{\cal H}_{ab}^F 
+ \int_0^{\infty} \rd\qt^2 \;
\f{\rd{\hat \sigma}_{F \,ab}^{(\rm fin.)}}{\rd \qt^2}  \;\;,
\eeeq
where $d{\hat \sigma}_{F \,ab}^{(\rm fin.)}$ is directly related to the quantity in square bracket in the right-hand side of Eq.~\eqref{masterEqqT}
\beeq
\label{sigfin}
\f{\rd{\hat \sigma}_{F \,ab}^{(\rm fin.)}}{\rd \qt^2} \equiv \left[ \f{\rd{\hat \sigma}_{ab}^{F+{\rm jets}}}{\rd \qt^2} - \f{\rd{\hat \sigma}_{ab}^{F\;{\rm CT}}}{\rd \qt^2}\right]\;.
\eeeq
Using Eqs.~\eqref{reslean} and \eqref{whathlean}, it is possible to write ${\cal H}_{gg}^H$ in terms of the functions $C_{g \,a}(z_1;\as)$ and $G_{g \,a}(z_1;\as)$ (in the particular case $F=H$). Omitting the scale-dependent terms that are all known analytically (i.e.\ considering $\mu_{F}=\mu_{R}=M$), we have 
\begin{equation}
\label{HCCGG}
{\cal H}^H_{gg\ito ab}(z;\as) \equiv H_g^H(\as) \!\int_0^1\!\rd z_1 \int_0^1\!\rd z_2
\,\delta(z - z_1z_2)
\Big[ C_{g \,a}(z_1;\as) C_{g \,b}(z_2;\as)
+ G_{g \,a}(z_1;\as) G_{g \,b}(z_2;\as)\Big]\, .
\end{equation}
This expression for ${\cal H}_{ab}^F$ was written requiring specifically $F=H$, since its form depends on the initial state of the Born subprocess (quark annihilation or gluon fusion).
Notice two main differences between Eqs.~\eqref{whathlean} and \eqref{HCCGG}. The first difference is related to the fact that the function  ${\cal H}^H$ depends on the energy fraction $z$, due to the convolution integral (over the momentum fractions $z_1$ and $z_2$) in the right-hand side of Eq.~\eqref{HCCGG}. The second difference concerns the scale of $\as$: in the functions $H^H_g(\as), C(\as)$ and $G(\as)$ on the right-hand side of Eq.~\eqref{HCCGG}, the strong coupling constant is evaluated at a common scale, which is not explicitly denoted in the above equation. Owing to this feature, the process-dependent function ${\cal H}^H_{gg\ito ab}$ is unambiguously defined
(i.e.\ it is independent of the resummation scheme)~\cite{Catani:2000vq}. The ${\cal H}^H$ function in Eq.~\eqref{HCCGG} can be expanded perturbatively without approximation to any order in the strong coupling constant $\as$.
The perturbative expansion of the function
${\cal H}^H$ directly follows from Eqs.~\eqref{cgexp}--\eqref{hexp} and for the first-order and second-order contributions we have
\begin{align}
\label{H1}
{\cal H}^{H;(1)}_{gg\ito ab}(z)&=\delta_{g\,a} \,\delta_{g\,b} \,\delta(1-z) 
\,H^{H;(1)}_g+
\delta_{g\,a} \,C^{(1)}_{g\,b}(z)+\delta_{g\,b} \,C^{(1)}_{g\,a}(z) \;\; , \\
\label{H2}
{\cal H}^{H;(2)}_{gg\ito ab}(z)&=\delta_{g\,a} \,\delta_{g\,b} \,\delta(1-z)
\,H^{H;(2)}_g
+\delta_{g\,a} \,C^{(2)}_{g\,b}(z)+\delta_{g\,b} \,C^{(2)}_{g\,a}(z)
\nn\\
&
+H^{H;(1)}_g\left(\delta_{g\,a} \,C^{(1)}_{g\,b}(z)
+\delta_{g\,b} \,C^{(1)}_{g\,a}(z)\right)
+\left(C^{(1)}_{g\,a}\otimes C^{(1)}_{g\,b}\right)(z)+
\left(G^{(1)}_{g\,a}\otimes G^{(1)}_{g\,b}\right)(z)\;\; .
\end{align}
In Eq.~\eqref{H2} and in the following, the symbol $\otimes$ denotes the 
convolution integral
(i.e., we define 
$(g \otimes h) (z) \equiv \int_0^1 dz_1 \int_0^1 dz_2
\,\delta(z - z_1z_2) \;g(z_1) \;h(z_2)$).
The new third-order contribution is given by
\begin{align}
\label{H3}
{\cal H}^{H;(3)}_{gg\ito ab}(z)&=
\delta_{g\,a} \,\delta_{g\,b} \,\delta(1-z)\,H^{H;(3)}_g
+\delta_{g\,a} \,C^{(3)}_{g\,b}(z)
+\delta_{g\,b} \,C^{(3)}_{g\,a}(z)\nn\\
&
+\left(G^{(1)}_{g\,a}\otimes G^{(2)}_{g\,b}\right)(z)
+\left(G^{(2)}_{g\,a}\otimes G^{(1)}_{g\,b}\right)(z)\nn\\
&
+H^{H;(1)}_g\left(\delta_{g\,a} \,C^{(2)}_{g\,b}(z)
+\delta_{g\,b} \,C^{(2)}_{g\,a}(z)\right)
+H^{H;(2)}_g\left(\delta_{g\,a} \,C^{(1)}_{g\,b}(z)
+\delta_{g\,b} \,C^{(1)}_{g\,a}(z)\right)\nn\\
&
+\left(C^{(1)}_{g\,a}\otimes C^{(2)}_{g\,b}\right)(z)+
\left(C^{(2)}_{g\,a}\otimes C^{(1)}_{g\,b}\right)(z)\nn\\
&
+ H^{H;(1)}_g  \left(C^{(1)}_{g\,a}\otimes C^{(1)}_{g\,b}\right)(z) 
 +    H^{H;(1)}_g  \left(G^{(1)}_{g\,a}\otimes G^{(1)}_{g\,b}\right)(z) \;.         
\end{align}
As stated in Sec.~\ref{sec:forma}, the second-order helicity-flip functions $G^{(2)}_{g\,a}(z)$ and the third-order collinear functions $C^{(3)}_{g\,a}(z)$ are not known. In addition, the third-order hard--virtual coefficient $H^{H;(3)}_g$ is not fully determined. In the following, we describe a procedure to obtain an approximation to these missing contributions. 


The relation in Eq.~\eqref{sigtotrel} is valid order-by-order in QCD perturbation theory. If the perturbative coefficients of the fixed order expansion of ${\hat \sigma}_{F \,ab}^{{\rm {tot}}}$, ${\cal H}_{ab}^F$ and  $\rd{\hat \sigma}_{F \,ab}^{(\rm fin.)}/\rd \qt^2$ are all known, the relation~\eqref{sigtotrel} has to be regarded as an identity, which can be explicitly checked. Since the fixed-order truncation of $ \rd{\hat \sigma}_{F \,ab}^{(\rm fin.)}/{\rd \qt^2}$ is free of any contribution proportional to $\delta(\qt^2)$, its NLO contribution  does not contain the coefficient ${\cal H}_{ab}^{F \,;(1)}$, and so forth. 
Therefore, ${\cal H}_{ab}^{F \,;(3)}$ can be isolated from the 
 the  N$^{3}$LO  term in Eq.~\eqref{sigtotrel}:
\beeq
\label{h3nnlo}
&&\left( \f{\as}{\pi} \right)^3\;\f{M^2}{\hat s} 
\sum_c \sigma_{c{\bar c}, \,F}^{(0)}(\as,M)
\; {\cal H}_{c{\bar c} \ito 
ab}^{F \,;(3)}\!\left(\f{M^2}{\hat s};
\f{M^2}{\mu_R^2},\f{M^2}{\mu_F^2}\right) \nn \\
&& \quad = \left\{
\Bigl[ {\hat \sigma}_{F \,ab}^{{\rm {tot}}} \Bigr]_{\rm N^{3}LO} 
- \Bigl[ {\hat \sigma}_{F \,ab}^{{\rm {tot}}} \Bigr]_{\rm NNLO} 
\right\}
- \int_0^{\infty} \rd\qt^2 
\left\{
\Bigl[ \f{\rd{\hat \sigma}_{F \,ab}^{(\rm fin.)}}{\rd \qt^2} 
\Bigr]_{\rm N^{3}LO} - 
\Bigl[ \f{\rd{\hat \sigma}_{F \,ab}^{(\rm fin.)}}{\rd \qt^2} 
\Bigr]_{\rm NNLO}
\right\}\;\;,
\eeeq
where $\as=\as(\mu_R^2)$, subscripts on the square brackets denoting the respective truncation orders, 
 and where we have used
\begin{equation}
\Bigl[ {\hat \sigma}_{F \,ab}^{{\rm {tot}}}(M,{\hat s};
\as) \Bigr]_{\rm LO} = \delta(1 - M^2/\hat s)
\;\sum_c \sigma_{c{\bar c}, \,F}^{(0)}(\as,M) \;\delta_{ca} 
\;\delta_{{\bar c}b} \;\;.
\end{equation}
The generalization at any order $n > 1$ is~\cite{Bozzi:2005wk}
\beeq
\label{hn}
&&\left( \f{\as}{\pi} \right)^n\;\f{M^2}{\hat s} 
\sum_c \sigma_{c{\bar c}, \,F}^{(0)}(\as,M)
\; {\cal H}_{c{\bar c} \ito 
ab}^{F \,;(n)}\left(\f{M^2}{\hat s};
\f{M^2}{\mu_R^2},\f{M^2}{\mu_F^2}\right) \\
&& \quad = \left\{
\Bigl[ {\hat \sigma}_{F \,ab}^{{\rm {tot}}} \Bigr]_{\rm N^nLO} 
- \Bigl[ {\hat \sigma}_{F \,ab}^{{\rm {tot}}} \Bigr]_{\rm N^{n-1}LO} 
\right\} 
- \int_0^{\infty} \rd\qt^2 
\left\{
\Bigl[ \f{\rd{\hat \sigma}_{F \,ab}^{(\rm fin.)}}{\rd \qt^2} 
\Bigr]_{\rm N^{n}LO} - 
\Bigl[ \f{\rd{\hat \sigma}_{F \,ab}^{(\rm fin.)}}{\rd \qt^2} 
\Bigr]_{\rm N^{n-1}LO}
\right\} . \nn
\eeeq
At LO, where only the Born subprocess is available, $\Bigl[ \f{\rd{\hat \sigma}_{F \,ab}^{(\rm fin.)}}{\rd \qt^2} \Bigr]_{\rm LO}$ is zero by definition. Notice that in Eqs.~\eqref{h3nnlo} and \eqref{hn} the full  ${\cal H}_{c{\bar c} \ito ab}^{F \,;(n)}$ coefficient is used, i.e., the scale independent terms as well as the terms that we omitted in Eq.~\eqref{HCCGG} (and therefore in Eqs.~\eqref{H1}, \eqref{H2} and \eqref{H3}) embody the scale dependence through the ratios $M^{2}/\mu^{2}_{F}$ and $M^{2}/\mu^{2}_{R}$.

If all the components on the right-hand side of Eq.~\eqref{hn} are known analytically (as it was the case at NNLO in Refs.~\cite{Catani:2011kr,Catani:2012qa}) the function ${\cal H}_{ab}^{F}$ can be extracted exactly in analytical form. At NLO the extraction of the function  ${\cal H}_{ab}^{F \,;(1)}$ is straightforward for Drell--Yan and Higgs boson production. The function ${\cal H}_{ab}^{F \,;(2)}$ at NNLO (for Higgs ($F=H$) boson production~\cite{Catani:2011kr} and Drell--Yan ($F=DY$)~\cite{Catani:2012qa}) can be obtained with a dedicated analytical computation using Eq.~\eqref{hn} for $n=2$. Since for Higgs boson production, the transverse momentum cross section $H$+jet at NNLO is not known analytically, Eq.~\eqref{h3nnlo} can be used only numerically to compute ${\cal H}_{ab}^{F\,;(3)}$. 

The following paragraphs will focus on the details of the approximation that we intend to use. Instead of computing the entire third order function ${\cal H}_{ab}^{H\,;(3)}$ numerically, we first report all its ingredients with the aim of reducing the numerical extraction to only a few components (perturbative functions). 

The general structure of the coefficient ${\cal H}^{F \,;(3)}$ (which is proportional to $\delta(\qt^{2})$) is not known in analytic form for any hard-scattering process. Nonetheless, within the $\qt$ subtraction  formalism, ${\cal H}^{F \,;(3)}$ can be reliably approximated for any hard-scattering process whose corresponding total cross section is known at N$^{3}$LO. 

At N$^{3}$LO, the universal relation between $H^{F;(3)}_{c}$ and the third-order virtual correction to the partonic subprocess $c{\bar c}\to F$ presents one missing ingredient: a {\em single} coefficient (of {\em soft} origin) belonging to the finite part of the structure of the IR singularities contained in the
third-order virtual amplitude of the corresponding partonic subprocess $c{\bar c}\to F$. Although a general prescription to compute the hard--virtual coefficient $H^{H;(3)}_{g}$ analytically is not fully known, using the corresponding hard--virtual factor $C^{{\rm th}(3)}_{gg\to H}$~\cite{Catani:2014uta} from threshold resummation (in the large-$m_t$ limit) and the exponential equation that relates hard--virtual coefficients in threshold- and $\qt$-resummation (Eq.~(81) of Ref.~\cite{Catani:2013tia}), we compute the following approximated expression

Notice that we neglect all the third-order terms in the exponent of Eq.~(81) in Ref.~\cite{Catani:2013tia}, considering the entire $\mathcal{O}(\as^{3})$ correction (in the exponent) as unknown. However, the full top-mass dependence of $H^{H;(3)}_g$ is already fully embodied in $\widetilde{H}^{H;(3)}_{g}$.
The $\widetilde{H}^{H;(3)}_{g}$ coefficient in Eq.~\eqref{H3approx} will be used in the numerical computations below.

The missing terms in Eq.~\eqref{H3approx}, concerning the final and full expression of $H^{H;(3)}_g$, have a {\em soft} origin. Following the notation of Ref.~\cite{Catani:2013tia}, all the third-order terms in the right-hand side of Eq.~(81) of Ref.~\cite{Catani:2013tia} are denoted by $\delta^{\qt}_{(2)}$. This allows to perform a subsequent decomposition for the third-order hard--virtual coefficient defined in Eq.~\eqref{H3approx}
\beeq
\label{H3deltaqT2}
\widetilde{H}^{H;(3)}_{g}  \equiv H^{H;(3)}_g  -  \big[H^{H;(3)}_{g}\big]_{(\delta^{\qt}_{(2)})} \;.
\eeeq
As a consequence, the only missing ingredients to ${\cal H}^{F \,;(3)}$  are 
 the functions $G^{(2)}_{g\,a}(z)$, $C^{(3)}_{g\,a}(z)$ and $ \big[H^{H;(3)}_{g}\big]_{(\delta^{\qt}_{(2)})}$. 
 Their contribution to  Eq.~\eqref{h3nnlo} can be approximated as follows:
\beeq
\label{CN3eq}
C_{N3}\;\;\delta_{g\,a} \,\delta_{g\,b} \,\delta(1-z) && \!\!\!\!\!\! \leftarrow\;\; \delta_{g\,a} \,\delta_{g\,b} \,\delta(1-z)
\,\big[H^{H;(3)}_{g}\big]_{(\delta^{\qt}_{(2)})}
+\delta_{g\,a} \,C^{(3)}_{g\,b}(z)+\delta_{g\,b} \,C^{(3)}_{g\,a}(z)\nn\\
&&
+\left(G^{(1)}_{g\,a}\otimes G^{(2)}_{g\,b}\right)(z)+\left(G^{(2)}_{g\,a}\otimes G^{(1)}_{g\,b}\right)(z) \;\;, 
\eeeq
where the third-order numerical coefficient $C_{N3}$ embodies the numerical extraction of the hard--virtual coefficient $\big[H^{H;(3)}_{g}\big]_{(\delta^{\qt}_{(2)})}$  \textit{plus} the numerical approximation of a function of the variable $z$ by a numerical term proportional to $\delta(1-z)$. The resulting numerical coefficient $\big[H^{H;(3)}_{g}\big]_{(\delta^{\qt}_{(2)})}$ is exact since $C_{N3}$ is proportional to $\delta(1-z)$. The approximation that implies Eq.~\eqref{CN3eq} is related only to the functions  $G^{(2)}_{g\,a}(z)$ and $C^{(3)}_{g\,a}(z)$, whose functional dependence on the variable $z$ goes beyond terms proportional to $\delta(1-z)$, and which involve not only gluon-to-gluon transitions ($a=g$), but also contributions from 
other parton species ($a=q,\bar q$). The latter are not explicitly distinguished in the above approximation, which fully 
attributes their numerical contribution to the gluon-induced processes. 

The method outlined in Eq.~\eqref{CN3eq} to approximate the unknown terms in the hard--virtual function ${\cal H}^H_{gg\ito ab}(z)$ numerically is not new. It was first used in Ref.~\cite{Bozzi:2005wk} in order to compute the second order function ${\cal H}^{H;(2)}_{gg\ito ab}(z)$ numerically at NNLO, providing a reasonable estimate of the exact result to better than $1\%$ accuracy. Notice that Eq.~\eqref{CN3eq} allows to recover the total cross section (at N$^{3}$LO in this case) with no approximation. After integration over the transverse momentum $\qt$, Eq.~\eqref{restotp} provides the same total integral (numerically in this case)  as in the fully analytical case. Even more, for IR-safe observables (at fixed order) where the \textit{back-to-back} kinematical configuration ($\qt=0$) is located at a single phase space point (e.g.\ the $\qt$ distribution, the angular separation $\Delta \Phi _{\gamma\gamma}$ between the two photons for a Higgs boson decaying into diphotons, etc.), the fixed order result is also exact, i.e.\ the integral of the analytical unknown terms in Eq.~\eqref{CN3eq} (which all have $\qt=0$) is located in one single point of the exclusive differential distributions. 

The previous considerations about the approximation that proposes Eq.~\eqref{CN3eq} were regarding the total cross section or differential distributions in which the Born-like configurations belong to one single phase space point.
In order to quantify the quality of the approximation proposed in Eq.~\eqref{CN3eq} at the differential level when the Born differential cross section populates the entire differential range, we perform a detailed numerical study of the Higgs boson rapidity $y_{H}$ distribution in Sec.~\ref{sec:NNLOrap} at NNLO. Anticipating these results,  we find that in the rapidity range $0\leq y_{H}\leq 4$ the approximated NNLO result differs by less than $0.2\%$ from the exact NNLO Higgs boson rapidity distribution.

\subsection{Implementation and setup of the numerical calculations}
\label{sec:numsetup}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
To extract the value of $C_{N3}$, we first introduce the numerical tools and the calculational setup in this section. We use the same setup for the inclusive and differential predictions presented in Sections~\ref{sec:numCN3}, \ref{sec:NNLOrap}, \ref{sec:N3LOrap} and \ref{sec:results}.

We consider Higgs boson production in proton--proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV. In our computation, we set the Higgs boson mass to $M_H= 125$~GeV and the vacuum expectation value to $v=246.2$~GeV. 
The Born process is initiated via gluon--gluon fusion mediated through a top-quark loop, which can be integrated out in the large-$m_t$ limit ($m_{t}\rightarrow \infty$).
In this limit, the production of the Higgs boson is described through an effective gluon-gluon-Higgs boson vertex~\cite{Heft}.
The mass of the top quark is taken as $m_t = 173.2$~GeV, which enters in the contributions that have a residual $m_t$ dependence (e.g.\ Eqs.~\eqref{H2g} and \eqref{H3approx} and effective vertex coefficient corrections at N$^3$LO). 
With the top quark loop replaced by an effective vertex, we consider a five-flavour scheme QCD with all light quarks being massless. We use the central set of the \verb|PDF4LHC15| PDFs~\cite{nnpdf} as implemented in the \texttt{LHAPDF} framework~\cite{Buckley:2014ana} and the associated strong coupling constant with $\as(M_Z)=0.118$. Note that we systematically employ the same order in the PDFs (in particular the set \verb|PDF4LHC15_nnlo_mc|) for the LO, NLO, NNLO and N$^{3}$LO results presented in this paper. The central factorization and renormalization scale is chosen as $\mu \equiv \mu_R = \mu_F =  M_H / 2$. The theoretical uncertainty is estimated by varying the default scale choice independently for $\mu_R$ and $\mu_F$ by factors of $\{1/2,2\}$ while omitting combinations with $\mu_R/\mu_F = 4$ or $1/4$, resulting in the common seven-point variation of scale combinations. 

As stated in Sec.~\ref{sec:numforCN3} and in Ref.~\cite{Catani:2007vq}, the computation of the total cross section or differential distributions with the  $\qt$ subtraction formalism can be separated into two main parts by inserting Eq.~\eqref{sigfin} into Eq.~\eqref{sigtotrel}:
\beeq
\label{sigtotnumerical} 
{\hat \sigma}_{F \,ab}^{{\rm {tot}}}
 = \left[\f{M^2}{\hat s} \;{\cal H}_{ab}^F - \int_0^{\infty} \rd\qt^2 \;
   \f{\rd{\hat \sigma}_{ab}^{F\;{\rm CT}}}{\rd \qt^2}\right]
+ \int_0^{\infty} \rd\qt^2 \;\f{\rd{\hat \sigma}_{ab}^{F+{\rm jets}}}{\rd \qt^2} \;\;.
\eeeq
Regarding the $\rd{\hat \sigma}_{ab}^{F+{\rm jets}}$ contribution in Eq.~\eqref{sigtotnumerical}, we make use of the parton-level event generator \texttt{NNLOJET} which provides the necessary infrastructure for the antenna subtraction method up to NNLO~\cite{Antenna:method}. This program performs the integration of all contributing subprocesses of the type  $\rd{\hat \sigma}_{ab}^{F+{\rm jets}}$ as well as the convolution with PDFs at this order. Processes at NNLO with the structure of $\rd{\hat \sigma}_{ab}^{F+{\rm jets}}$ implemented in \texttt{NNLOJET} are: $F=H$~\cite{Chen:2016zka}, $F=\gamma^*,~Z$~\cite{Ridder:2015dxa,Gehrmann-DeRidder:2016jns} and $F=W^{\pm}$~\cite{Gehrmann-DeRidder:2017mvr}. In this paper we focus on Higgs production $F=H$, where the relevant matrix elements in 
 \texttt{NNLOJET} are: ($H+1$)-parton production at two loops~\cite{Gehrmann:2011aa}, ($H+2$)-parton production at one loop~\cite{Dixon:2009uk,Badger:2009hw,Badger:2009vh} and ($H+3$)-parton 
 production at tree-level~\cite{DelDuca:2004wt,Dixon:2004za,Badger:2004ty}. The subtraction formalism that we are applying to Higgs boson production could be easily extended  to $Z$ and $W^{\pm}$ production. 

The terms in square brackets in Eq.~\eqref{sigtotnumerical}  are encoded in a new Monte Carlo generator \texttt{HN3LO} up to the third order in the strong coupling constant. After expanding Eq.~\eqref{reslean} to this order, several non-trivial convolutions emerge and we document the corresponding formulae implemented in \texttt{HN3LO} in Appendix~\ref{app:Convos}. All our results up to the NNLO level are in agreement with the Monte Carlo generator \texttt{HNNLO}~\cite{Catani:2007vq} at the per mille level of accuracy. On the right-hand side of Eq.~\eqref{h3nnlo}, the partonic Higgs boson total cross sections at NNLO ($\bigl[ {\hat \sigma}_{H}^{{\rm {tot}}} \bigr]_{\rm NNLO}$) and N$^{3}$LO  ($\bigl[ {\hat \sigma}_{H}^{{\rm {tot}}} \bigr]_{\rm N^{3}LO}$) are also required. We use the analytical coefficient function for the 
total Higgs boson cross section at N$^{3}$LO $\bigl[  \sigma_{H}^{{\rm {tot}}} \bigr]_{\rm N^{3}LO}$ (i.e.\ $\bigl[ {\hat \sigma}_{H}^{{\rm {tot}}} \bigr]_{\rm N^{3}LO}$ convoluted with the PDFs)  calculated recently in Ref.~\cite{Mistlberger:2018etf} and  use the public code \texttt{ihixs 2}~\cite{Dulat:2018rbf} to compute not only the N$^{3}$LO cross section, but also
 any of the analytical total cross-section ingredients required to extract the missing coefficient $C_{N3}$.

The numerical computation of the integral of the difference $\rd{\sigma}_{\rm{NNLO}}^{F+{\rm jets}}-\rd{\sigma}_{\rm{N}^3\rm{LO}}^{F {\rm\ CT}}$ in Eq.~\eqref{sigfin}, although finite, requires the introduction of a suitable technical lower bound or $\qtcut$, since both terms in this difference are logarithmically divergent at $\qtcut \to 0$. 
 This technical cut introduces systematic uncertainties to both $\rd{\sigma}_{\rm{NNLO}}^{F+{\rm jets}}$ and $\rd{\sigma}_{\rm{N}^3\rm{LO}}^{F {\rm\ CT}}$. Once cancellations between the terms on the right-hand side of Eq.~\eqref{sigtotnumerical} take place, the numerically calculated total cross sections and differential distributions have to be $\qtcut$ independent (within the statistical errors) over some range of $\qtcut$. At the lower end of this range, 
numerical instabilities in $\rd{\sigma}_{\rm{NNLO}}^{F+{\rm jets}}$ (arising from the large dynamical range in this calculation) 
will limit the accuracy of the result, while at the 
higher end of the range, missing non-logarithmic terms in  $\rd{\sigma}_{\rm{N}^3\rm{LO}}^{F {\rm\ CT}}$ will start to 
become significant. 
The numerical stability of $\rd{\sigma}_{\rm{NNLO}}^{F+{\rm jet}}$ at small $\qt$ using \texttt{NNLOJET} has been systematically validated for Higgs boson production (with $\qtcut=0.7$~GeV in Ref.~\cite{Chen:2018pzu}) and Drell--Yan production (with $\qtcut=2$~GeV in Ref.~\cite{Bizon:2018foh}) at the LHC. In Sections~\ref{sec:numCN3}, \ref{sec:NNLOrap}, \ref{sec:N3LOrap} and \ref{sec:results}, we document numerical results obtained with the $\qt$ subtraction formalism using $\qtcut=(2\pm 1)$~GeV.

\subsection{The numerical extraction of \texorpdfstring{$C_{N3}$}{CN3}}
\label{sec:numCN3}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the following, we describe the numerical results regarding the extraction of the $C_{N3}$ coefficient and the corresponding N$^3$LO total cross section. 

%%====================================
\begin{figure}[tb]

\includegraphics[width=.6\linewidth]{./new_figures/finN3LO}
\caption{\label{fig:finiten3lo}{The $\qt$ integrated finite contribution to the cross section of Eq.~\eqref{sigfin} at N$^{3}$LO-only (i.e.\ N$^{3}$LO-NNLO) between $\qtcut$ and $\infty$, for three different scales ($\mu=\mu_{R}=\mu_{F}$).}}
\end{figure}
%%====================================

In Fig.~\ref{fig:finiten3lo} we display the $\sigma_{F=H}^{(\rm fin.)}$ (i.e.\ ${\hat \sigma}_{H}^{(\rm fin.)}$ convoluted with the PDFs) cross section at $\rm N^3LO$-only as a function of the $\qtcut$. With $\rm N^3LO$-only we denote the the N$^3$LO \emph{coefficient} given by the difference $\Bigl[ \sigma_{H}^{(\rm fin.)}\Bigr]_{\rm N^{3}LO} - \Bigl[ \sigma_{H}^{(\rm fin.)}\Bigr]_{\rm NNLO}$. 
The error bars denote the numerical integration errors from  \texttt{NNLOJET}. Since the figure displays cumulant cross sections as function of the lower integration boundary, the central values and errors are fully correlated among the points.
Using Eq.~\eqref{H3} with Eq.~\eqref{h3nnlo} and the value of the resulting integral $ \sigma_{H}^{(\rm fin.)}(\qtcut=1~{\rm GeV})$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:finiten3lo}, it is possible to obtain the $\qt$ integrated cross section of the unknown terms on the right-hand side of Eq.~\eqref{CN3eq} and consequently extract $C_{N3}$. 

The behaviour of the $\rm N^3LO$ $\sigma_{H}^{(\rm fin.)}$ cross section as a function of $\qtcut$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:finiten3lo} allows also to estimate the systematical uncertainty corresponding to the use of this technical cut which turns out to be at the \textit{per mille} level in the domain $\qtcut=(2\pm 1)$~GeV for the total Higgs boson cross section at $\rm N^3LO$. More specifically, variations of the $\qtcut$ parameter from $\qtcut=1$~GeV to 3~GeV produce variations in the central value of the 
$\rm N^3LO$ contribution to $\sigma_{H}^{(\rm fin.)}$ cross section of less than $0.35\%$ for the scales $\mu=M_{H}$ and $\mu=M_{H}/2$, and variations of the order of $2\%$ for $\mu=M_{H}/4$. These variations are considerably smaller than the numerical integration error at fixed $\qtcut$.

%%====================================

In Table~\ref{Table:CN3values} and Figure~\ref{fig:CN3qT},
we collect the values of $C_{N3}$ extracted for all seven combinations of scale 
choices and three different values of $\qtcut$. 
We note that the central value of each $C_{N3}$ is independent of the scale (within the uncertainties), in complete agreement with Eq.~\eqref{H3}. This scale independence of $C_{N3}$ is unrelated to the ansatz of Eq.~\eqref{CN3eq}: the terms in the right-hand side of Eq.~\eqref{H3} are all scale independent and the relation between $C_{N3}$ and $\widetilde{H}^{H;(3)}_{g}$ is defined through Eqs.~\eqref{H3}, \eqref{H3deltaqT2} and \eqref{CN3eq}. The uncertainties shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CN3qT} are determined using conventional error propagation and are almost entirely dominated by the size of the statistical errors of the $\rm N^3LO$ $\sigma_{H}^{(\rm fin.)}$ cross section shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:finiten3lo}.

Since the resulting cross sections at different scale values are statistically correlated, we propose as our estimation for the $C_{N3}$ coefficient the value obtained for  $\qtcut=1$~GeV   at the central scale $\mu_F=\mu_R=M_{H}/2$, $C_{N3}=-943 \pm 222$, which is indicated in bold typeface in Table~\ref{Table:CN3values}.
The solid red central line in Fig.~\ref{fig:CN3qT}, and the associated red band are obtained using this single value.

%%====================================

The numerically extracted $C_{N3}$ coefficient allows the total cross section to be computed at N$^{3}$LO using 
the $\qt$ subtraction method, which serves as a closure test of the approach and the approximations used,  and allows the impact of uncertainties associated with the numerical evaluation of the ingredients to be quantified. 
In Fig.~\ref{fig:totXsecN3LO} we compare the fully analytical N$^{3}$LO Higgs boson total cross section~\cite{Mistlberger:2018etf} (red dot) and our estimation (red dot with error bar) for three central scales, using $\qtcut=2$~GeV. The yellow dots with error bar represent our best approximation without the use of the $C_{N3}$ coefficient (i.e.\ $C_{N3}=0$), that can be considered as the prediction of the $\qt$ subtraction method in the case in which the total cross section is unknown (e.g.\ for Drell--Yan at N$^{3}$LO). The uncertainty bars in the $\qt$ subtraction prediction correspond to the statistical errors of the numerical computations and are mainly due to the finite contribution in Eq.~\eqref{sigfin} at N$^{3}$LO-only. The green crosses and purple squares correspond to our N$^{3}$LO prediction using $\qtcut=1$~GeV and 3~GeV respectively. Notice that the $\qtcut$ variation is performed at N$^{3}$LO-only, while the NNLO cross section is evaluated at fixed $\qtcut$ parameter.
The NNLO cross section is also shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:totXsecN3LO} (blue dots) in order to put the size of the N$^{3}$LO corrections in relation to the previous perturbative order. The total cross sections shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:totXsecN3LO} are reported in Table~\ref{Table:totXsec}.

\section{The rapidity distribution of the Higgs boson}
\label{sec:rapgen}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this section we use the $C_{N3}$ coefficient (extracted in Sec.~\ref{sec:numCN3}) to produce differential predictions at N$^{3}$LO. In particular, we present differential results for the rapidity distribution of the Higgs boson. In Sec.~\ref{sec:NNLOrap}  we first estimate at NNLO the uncertainties introduced in the rapidity distribution by the procedure proposed in Eq.~\eqref{CN3eq}. In Sec.~\ref{sec:N3LOrap} we present the rapidity distribution at N$^{3}$LO with the
 estimation of the uncertainties associated to the variation of the $\qtcut$ and $C_{N3}$ parameters.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{The NNLO rapidity distribution}
\label{sec:NNLOrap}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this section we aim to quantify the uncertainty in the approximation used in Eq.~\eqref{CN3eq}. This approximation was first proposed in Ref.~\cite{Bozzi:2005wk} for Higgs production at NNLO. Since all the ingredients of the $\qt$ subtraction formalism at NNLO are known in analytical form~\cite{Catani:2011kr}, it is possible to quantify the difference induced by the approximation compared to the exact result. This analysis further allows to assess the potential impact of the approximation that could be present at N$^3$LO in Sec.~\ref{sec:N3LOrap} and \ref{sec:results} below. For this quantitative study we consider the collinear functions $C^{(1)}_{g\,a}$ and the hard--virtual factor $H^{H;(1)}_g$ in Eq.~\eqref{H2} as known. The collinear functions $C^{(2)}_{g\,a}$ and the first order helicity-flip functions $G^{(1)}_{g\,a}$ are regarded as unknown. The hard--virtual factor $H^{H;(2)}_g$ is divided in two contributions in analogy to Eq.~\eqref{H3deltaqT2}
\beeq
\widetilde{H}^{H;(2)}_{g}  \equiv H^{H;(2)}_g  -  \big[H^{H;(2)}_{g}\big]_{(\delta^{\qt}_{(1)})} \;,
\eeeq
where $\big[H^{H;(2)}_{g}\big]_{(\delta^{\qt}_{(1)})}$ is considered as unknown for the present NNLO study.

These so-called \textit{unknown functions} (for this exercise) which depend on the variable $z$ in Eq.~\eqref{H2} are approximated with a single numerical coefficient $C_{N2}$ proportional to $\delta(1-z)$ (the $C_{N2}$ here was labeled as $C_{N}$ in Ref.~\cite{Bozzi:2005wk}):
\beeq
\label{CNeq}
C_{N2}\;\;\delta_{g\,a} \,\delta_{g\,b} \,\delta(1-z) && \!\!\!\!\!\! \leftarrow\;\; \delta_{g\,a} \,\delta_{g\,b} \,\delta(1-z)
\, \big[H^{H;(2)}_{g}\big]_{(\delta^{\qt}_{(1)})}\nn\\
&&+\delta_{g\,a} \,C^{(2)}_{g\,b}(z)+\delta_{g\,b} \,C^{(2)}_{g\,a}(z)+
\left(G^{(1)}_{g\,a}\otimes G^{(1)}_{g\,b}\right)(z)\;\; .
\eeeq 
In Fig.~\ref{fig:yHCN} we show the rapidity distribution of the Higgs boson at NNLO computed with the exact $\qt$ subtraction (blue hatched band) and the NNLO prediction using the $C_{N2}$ coefficient (dot, cross and square points). For this particular example at NNLO, we employ the three-point scale variation: $\mu=\mu_{R}=\mu_{F}=\{M_{H}/4,M_{H}/2,M_{H}\}$. Repeating the analysis performed for Table~\ref{Table:CN3values} and Fig.~\ref{fig:CN3qT}, we obtain: $C_{N2}=28\pm 1$. The numerical value of the $C_{N2}$ parameter corresponds to a specific $\widetilde{H}^{H;(2)}_{g}$ hard coefficient:
\begin{align}
\label{Ht2g}
\widetilde{H}^{H;(2)}_{g}&=\f{11399}{144}+\f{19}{8} L_{t}-\f{1189}{144} N_{f}+\f{2}{3} N_{f} L_{t}+\f{83}{6} \pi^{2} -\f{5}{18} \pi^{2} N_{f} + \f{13}{16} \pi^{4} - \f{165}{4} \zeta_{3} + \f{5}{6} N_{f} \zeta_{3}\;\;,
\end{align}
which is obtained with the same method that was used to arrive at Eq.~\eqref{H3approx}.
Using this $C_{N2}$ parameter we can produce differential predictions which are obtained \textit{mimicking} the strategy that we intend to apply at N$^{3}$LO. 

In the lower panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:yHCN} we show the ratio to the exact NNLO result, i.e.\ we present the ratio for each scale. As expected, the approximation presents its best behaviour at central rapidity and the deviation from the exact results is at \textit{per mille} level throughout the considered rapidity range of $|y_{H}|\leq 4$.

%The numerical implementation of the $\qt$ subtraction method (more precisely Eq.~\eqref{hn} at NNLO) requires the use of a technical cut ($\qtcut$) in the integral performed over the transverse momentum of the finite contribution in Eq.~\eqref{sigfin}. This $\qtcut$ lower bound replaces the formally  defined $q_{T}=0$ lower bound specified for instance in Eqs.~\eqref{sigtotrel} or \eqref{sigtotnumerical}.
%The computation of the NNLO Higgs boson cross section and differential distributions do not constitute a big numerical challenge, and the $\qtcut$ can be chosen as low as the computation demands. 
We performed at NNLO variations of the $\qtcut$ value between 0.1~GeV and 3~GeV, and the NNLO cross sections (and differential distributions) present deviations within a range of size $0.26\%$  (the largest deviation is always observed for the scale choice $\mu=M_{H}/4$).  We consider $\qtcut=1$ GeV enough to proceed at NNLO (and as our reference value), as we can understand from Table \ref{Table:totXsec} at NNLO.

In this section, we quantify the numerical stability (as well as the involved intrinsic uncertainties) of the Higgs boson rapidity distribution at N$^3$LO concerning the $\qtcut$ and $C_{N3}$ parameters and the statistical uncertainties introduced by $\rd\sigma_{F=H}^{(\rm fin.)}/\rd y_H$ at N$^3$LO-only.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:yHN3LOonly} we show the rapidity distribution at N$^{3}$LO obtained with the $\qt$ subtraction method using the $C_{N3}$ coefficient determined in Sec.~\ref{sec:numCN3} ($C_{N3}=-943 \pm 222$). The NNLO prediction is always computed with $\qtcut=1$~GeV. 
The red band in Fig.~\ref{fig:yHN3LOonly} shows the size of the seven-point scale variation for $\qtcut=2$~GeV. 

The pale yellow band is calculated as the envelope of the scale variation bands for two different values of $\qtcut$: 1~GeV and 2~GeV. Therefore, the pale yellow band in Fig.~\ref{fig:yHN3LOonly} can be taken as an estimate of the uncertainty due to the variation of the $\qtcut$ parameters at N$^{3}$LO. In Fig.~\ref{fig:totXsecN3LO} (and Table~\ref{Table:totXsec}), we observed that the total cross section (for the three central scales) is rather stable as a function of the $\qtcut$ value. The variations of the N$^{3}$LO cross sections were at the \textit{per mille} level of accuracy if we consider  $\qtcut=2 \pm 1$~GeV, which is far better than the associated statistical uncertainty (see Table~\ref{Table:totXsec}). The uncertainty estimate due to the $\qtcut$ variation performed in Fig.~\ref{fig:yHN3LOonly}, which is differential in the Higgs-boson rapidity, confirms the stability of the total cross section reported in Table~\ref{Table:totXsec}. 
The rapidity distribution is almost insensitive to the change in the $\qtcut$ parameter in the region where the bulk of the cross section is concentrated ($|y_{H}| \leq 3.6$). At large rapidities ($|y_{H}| \sim 4$), where the overall contribution to the total cross section is less than $0.5\%$, we found the largest deviations. Such deviations are mainly related to the numerical uncertainties from $\rd\sigma_{F=H}^{(\rm fin.)}/\rd y_H$ at  N$^3$LO-only.
 
Finally, we consider the uncertainty introduced by the statistical errors of the $C_{N3}$ coefficient. The black band in Fig.~\ref{fig:yHN3LOonly} is obtained as the envelope of the seven-point scale variation at $\qtcut=2$~GeV now considering for each scale the two extremal $C_{N3}$ coefficients corresponding to its maximum and minimum statistical deviations: $C_{N3} =\{-1165,-721\}$. The envelope is therefore taken from a total of 14 rapidity distributions (two extremal predictions for each one of the seven scales). The net effect of this $C_{N3}$ variation result in an overall enlargement of the red band at $\qtcut=2$~GeV. Our final uncertainty estimate in the rapidity of the Higgs boson at N$^{3}$LO is computed as the envelope of three bands: seven-point scale variation only, combined with $\qtcut$ variation, and combined with $C_{N3}$ variation.

%%====================================

Figure~\ref{fig:yHN3LO} shows the rapidity distribution of the Higgs boson at LO (pale grey fill), NLO (green fill), NNLO (blue hatched) and N$^{3}$LO (red cross-hatched). 
The central scale ($\mu=M_{H}/2$) is shown as a solid line while the bands correspond to the envelope of seven-point scale variation. 
At N$^{3}$LO, the band additionally includes the uncertainties due to $\qtcut$ and $C_{N3}$ as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:N3LOrap}.
Going from LO to NNLO, the scale $\mu=M_{H}/2$ is always at the center of the respective scale variation band in Fig.~\ref{fig:yHN3LO}.  The central prediction at N$^{3}$LO, on the other hand, almost coincides with the upper edge of the band, as was already observed for the total cross section~\cite{Anastasiou:2015ema,Mistlberger:2018etf}, see Table~\ref{Table:totXsec} and Fig.~\ref{fig:totXsecN3LO}.
Figures~\ref{fig:totXsecN3LO} and \ref{fig:yHN3LO} respectively show a substantial reduction in the size of the scale variation band at N$^{3}$LO both in the total cross section and in differential distributions.

In the central rapidity region of $|y_{H}| \leq 3.6$, the impact of the N$^{3}$LO corrections on the NNLO result is almost independent of $y_{H}$ with a flat $K$-factor about $1.035$ for the central scale choice. The combined theoretical uncertainty at N$^3$LO is at most of $\pm 5 \%$ level with respect to the central scale choice. The uncertainty on the $y_H$ distribution is reduced by more than a factor of $1/2$ by going from NNLO to N$^3$LO. The N$^3$LO uncertainty band lies fully within the scale variation band at NNLO, exhibiting a stable perturbative behaviour. 
The only exception is the very high rapidity region, where the $\qtcut$ uncertainty becomes the dominant source for the size of the N$^{3}$LO band as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:yHN3LOonly}.

The N$^3$LO corrections to the Higgs boson rapidity distribution have been investigated recently in~\cite{Dulat:2017prg},
where an analytic calculation of the leading terms of the threshold expansion of the  rapidity-differential coefficient function 
was presented. Based on the behaviour of the threshold expansion for the total cross section~\cite{Anastasiou:2015ema}, 
it is anticipated that the currently known terms in the threshold expansion for the rapidity distribution~\cite{Dulat:2017prg} are not yet sufficient to provide a proper description.  
Comparing Fig.~\ref{fig:yHN3LO} with the results obtained in Ref.~\cite{Dulat:2017prg}, although with different choices of PDFs and scale-variation prescriptions, we observe that the central scale N$^3$LO values for the rapidity region $y_H < 0.5$ agree well between the two calculations. Both calculations display a considerable reduction of scale uncertainties going from NNLO to N$^3$LO in this central rapidity region. 
For the rapidity region $y_H > 1$, however, larger differences are observed between the two calculations, where the results using the $\qt$ subtraction formalism generally yield smaller N$^3$LO corrections 
(within the NNLO scale uncertainty band).

\section{Conclusions and outlook}
\label{Sec:conclu}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this paper we have performed a detailed study of Higgs boson production at the LHC using the $\qt$ subtraction formalism at N$^3$LO. We systematically describe the $\qt$ subtraction formalism for a generic colourless and massive system $F(\{q_i\})$ produced at hadron colliders. Fully differential cross sections for this type of final state system are separated into $\delta(\qt)$ and $\qt\ne 0$ contributions. The contribution for $\qt\ne 0$ is calculated, 
using a phase space cut-off $\qtcut$, as the difference between $F(\{q_i\})\rm{+jets}$ production and $\qt$ counter-terms. Specifically, we use the \texttt{NNLOJET} package to compute NNLO Higgs-plus-jet production and expand the Sudakov from factor in the hard resummation scheme to the matching order for the corresponding $\qt$ counter-terms. The contribution at $\delta(\qt^{2})$ is further factorized into convolutions of the Sudakov form factor, the hard--virtual function, the helicity-flip coefficient function, the hard--collinear coefficient function as well as the PDFs (Sec.~\ref{sec:forma}). The factorization guarantees that all the process-dependent contributions proportional to a form factor are included in the hard--virtual function, which depends on both initial- and final-state particles. All other factorized contributions only depend on the initial states. Some of the factorized ingredients contributing at $\delta(\qt^{2})$ are not known analytically at N$^3$LO for the moment. We collect all analytically available contributions and approximate the unknown pieces by a constant coefficient $C_{N3}$ which is scale- and process-independent (Sec.~\ref{sec:numforCN3}). Using the available inclusive total cross section for N$^3$LO Higgs production and the known pieces from  the $\qt$ subtraction formalism, we numerically extract the value of $C_{N3}$. By comparing the numerical values for $C_{N3}$ using different scales and $\qtcut$ setups in the extraction, we conclude from mutually consistent results that $C_{N3}$ is independent of the scale choice with a value obtained for $\mu=M_H/2$ and $\qtcut = 1$~GeV of $C_{N3}=-943\pm 222$ (Sec.~\ref{sec:numCN3}).

As a proof-of-concept implementation of the $\qt$ subtraction method at N$^3$LO,  we calculate the total cross section and rapidity distributions for Higgs boson production at LHC using a new Monte Carlo generator \texttt{HN3LO}. Using the extracted value of $C_{N3}$, we perform a closure test for the inclusive total cross section for three different scale choices and find excellent agreement with the exact results (from \texttt{ihixs 2}~\cite{Dulat:2018rbf}) at the $0.2\%$ level. For the differential rapidity distribution of the Higgs boson, we first study the systematic error from the $C_{N3}$ approximation by considering the NNLO calculation and introducing an approximate $C_{N2}$. The NNLO $y_H$ distribution exhibit per-mille level agreement between the $C_{N2}$ approximation and the exact result, supporting the reliability of the procedure. 
We calculate the $y_H$ distribution at N$^3$LO employing a seven-point scale variation and carefully assess systematic errors arising form different $\qtcut$ and $C_{N3}$ values. Compared to the NNLO $y_H$ distributions, we observe a large reduction of theory uncertainties by more than $50\%$ at N$^3$LO. The scale variation band at N$^3$LO stays within the NNLO band with a flat $K$-factor of about $1.035$ in the central rapidity region ($|y_H|\leq3.6$). Both the systematic error analysis and the phenomenological predictions confirm that our calculations at N$^3$LO using $\qt$ subtraction formalism are well under control. The approximation related to the $C_{N3}$ coefficient in our approach can be easily replaced by the full analytical results once available. 

With the upcoming larger data set and more accurate measurements of Higgs properties at the LHC, we prepare precise theoretical tools that could match the frontier accuracy of experimental results. More differential properties at N$^3$LO involving the Higgs boson and its decay products can be studied using the same framework established in this paper. The current N$^3$LO calculation, using the approximation of large top quark mass, attains a level of  precision that several 
other contributions will need to be taken into account for a full study of precision phenomenology~\cite{Anastasiou:2016cez}: finite top quark mass effects, heavy-light quark interference contributions  
and electroweak corrections.

\section{Convolutions at \texorpdfstring{N${}^\text{3}$LO}{N3LO}}
\label{app:Convos}
The numerical implementation of Eq.~\eqref{reslean} requires the computation of several convolutions between splitting functions, collinear and helicity-flip functions. In principle, taking the $N$-moments of the functions involved in the calculation, one can avoid the use of convolutions, since in $N$-space they correspond to simple products. However, the numerical implementation of Eq.~\eqref{reslean} in the Monte Carlo code \texttt{HN3LO} was carried out in the $z$-space (e.g.\ as in the codes \texttt{HNNLO}~\cite{Catani:2007vq}, \texttt{DYNNLO}~\cite{Catani:2009sm}, \texttt{2$\gamma$NNLO}~\cite{Catani:2011qz}, etc.), and therefore the new third order convolutions have to be calculated as well. 

The convolutions in Eqs.~\eqref{H2}, \eqref{H3}, \eqref{CN3eq} and \eqref{CNeq} between two functions ($f(z)$ and $g(z)$) of the the variable $z$ are defined through the following integral
\beeq
\left( f \otimes g \right)(z) \equiv \int^{1}_{z}~\f{\rd y}{y}~f\left(\f{z}{y}\right)~g(y)\;.
\eeeq
In the case of processes initiated by gluon fusion, the complete list of third order convolutions to be calculated can be found in Table~\ref{Table:convosN3LO}. All the remaining convolutions in Eq.~\eqref{reslean} at N$^{3}$LO already  contributed to the previous orders and they are regarded as known.

The symbol $\gamma_{ab}^{(n)}$ in Table~\ref{Table:convosN3LO} denotes the usual splitting functions of $n$-th order and they contribute to Eq.~\eqref{reslean}) since the PDFs have to be evolved from the scale $b_0^2/b^2$ to the factorization scale $\mu_{F}$.
The first three rows in Eq.~\eqref{Table:convosN3LO} were calculated in Ref.~\cite{Hoeschele:2012xc} and cross-checked with a dedicated computation for the results presented in this paper. The public \texttt{Mathematica} package \texttt{MT}~\cite{Hoeschele:2013gga} is used to calculate the necessary convolutions (i)--(vi) in Ref.~\cite{Hoeschele:2012xc}, which can be further expressed in terms of \textit{harmonic polylogarithms} (HPLs)~\cite{Remiddi:1999ew} using the \texttt{Mathematica} package \texttt{HPL}~\cite{Maitre:2005uu}. 
The remaining convolutions in Eqs. (vii)--(xii) of Table~\ref{Table:convosN3LO}  were computed  for this work. The \texttt{MT}~\cite{Hoeschele:2013gga} package is not able to solve all the convolutions of weight 3 and 4 that are needed in (vii)--(xii). For instance, the \texttt{MT} package cannot handle convolutions in which their result has to be expressed in terms of multiple polylogarithms (or {\em Goncharov polylogarithms} GPLs)~\cite{Goncharov:1998kja,Gehrmann:2000zt,Goncharov:2001iea} as it is the case when the collinear functions $C^{(2)}_{gj}$ are involved. For those, we have computed the convolutions (vii)--(xii) with a newly developed code \texttt{Convo}, which is able to provide results in terms of GPLs and also can handle terms that are individually divergent, but finite after addition.

The multiple polylogarithms can be defined recursively, for $n\geq 0$, via the iterated integral~\cite{Goncharov:1998kja,Gehrmann:2000zt,Goncharov:2001iea}
 \beq\label{MultPolyLogdef}
 G(a_1,\ldots,a_n;z)=\,\int_0^z\,\frac{\rd t}{t-a_1}\,G(a_2,\ldots,a_n;t)\,,\\
\eeq
with $G(z) = G(;z)=1$ (an exception being when $z=0$ in which case we put $G(0)=0$) and with $a_i\in \mathbb{C}$ are chosen constants and $z$ is a complex variable. For the convolutions in Table~\ref{Table:convosN3LO} the variable $z$ and the weights $a_1,\ldots,a_n$ are all real constants.

From the convolutions in Table~\ref{Table:convosN3LO} we quote some  examples which appear as building blocks in the computation of Eqs.~(vii)--(xii),
\beeq
\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!&&\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\bigg\{{\rm D}_{0}[1-y];\f{1}{y};1;y;y^{2}\bigg\} \otimes \left( \f{f(y)}{1+y} \right)\;\;,
\eeeq
with 
\beeq 
f(y)=\bigg\{{\rm Li}_{3}\left(\f{1}{1+y}\right); {\rm Li}_{3}(\pm y);&&\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!{\rm Li}_{2}(\pm y); {\rm Li}_{2}(1- y); {\rm Li}_{2}(\pm y) \ln(y);\nn\\
&&\ln^{2}(1+y)\ln(y);\ln(1+y)\ln^{2}(y)\bigg\}\;\;,
\eeeq
where the \textit{plus} distribution ${\rm D}_{0}[1-z]$ is defined as usual 
\beeq
\int^{1}_{0}\rd z~f(z)~{\rm D}_{0}[1-z] =\int^{1}_{0}\rd z~\f{f(z)}{(1-z)_{+}} = \int^{1}_{0}\f{\rd z}{1-z}\left( f(z)-f(1)\right)\;\;.
\eeeq
After performing all the convolutions listed in Table~\ref{Table:convosN3LO}, their final expressions (each one of the convolutions) are finite in the domain $z\in (0,1)$. Even more, convolutions evaluated in the domain $z\in (0,1)$ produce results in $\mathbb{R}$. It is possible to write the expressions in Table~\ref{Table:convosN3LO} (after simplifying) in terms of twelve GPLs that are not reducible to polylogarithmic functions of type ${\rm Li}_n(z)$, 
 and cannot be combined (e.g.\ through the \textit{shuffle} algebra) with other GPLs in order to produce simpler results. 
The list of the irreducible GPLs is presented in Table~\ref{Table:GPLsused}.

The precise identification of the Sudakov form factor $S_c$, the hard--virtual function 
$H_g^{F=H}$ and the hard--collinear coefficient functions, $C_{g\, a}$ and $G_{g\, a}$ is not unique, and the resummation formula~\eqref{reslean} is invariant under ``resummation scheme''  transformations~\cite{Catani:2000vq}:\footnote{This invariance can easily be proven by using the following renormalization-group identity:
\begin{equation}
\label{rgidenlean}
h(\as(b_0^2/b^2)) = h(\as(M^2)) \; \exp \left\{ 
-\int_{b_0^2/b^2}^{M^2} \frac{\rd q^2}{q^2} 
\;\beta(\as(q^2)) \;\frac{\rd \ln h(\as(q^2))}{\rd \ln \as(q^2)} 
\right\} \;\;,
\end{equation}
which is valid for any perturbative function $h(\as)$. Notice that Eq.~\eqref{rgidenlean} establishes the evolution of the perturbative functions from the scale $q^{2}=b_0^2/b^2$ to $q^{2}=M^2$. The QCD $\beta$-function and its corresponding $n$-order $\beta_n$ coefficient are defined as
\begin{equation}
\label{rge}
\f{\rd \ln \as(\mu^2)}{\rd \ln \mu^2} = \beta(\as(\mu^2)) = 
- \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} \beta_n \left( \f{\as}{\pi} \right)^{n+1}\;\;.
\end{equation}
The explicit expression of the first three coefficients~\cite{Tarasov:1980au,Larin:1993tp}, $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$ and
$\beta_2$ are
\begin{align}
\beta_0 &= \frac{1}{12} \left( 11 C_A - 2 N_f \right) \;\;,
\quad\quad \beta_1=  \frac{1}{24} 
\left( 17 C_A^2 - 5 C_A N_f - 3 C_F N_f \right) \;\;,\nn\\
\beta_2 &= \frac{1}{64} \left( \f{2857}{54} C_A^3
- \f{1415}{54} C_A^2 N_f - \f{205}{18} C_A C_F N_f + C_F^2 N_f
+ \f{79}{54} C_A N_f^2 + \f{11}{9} C_F N_f^2 \right) \;\;,
\end{align}
where $N_f$ is the number of massless QCD flavours and the $SU(N_c)$ colour factors are $C_A=N_c$  and $C_F=(N_c^2-1)/(2N_c)$.}
